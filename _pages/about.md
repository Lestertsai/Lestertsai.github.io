I’m a first-year PhD student in the [Boni Lab](https://mol.ax) at [Temple Unviersity](https://www.temple.edu). My research focuses on the epidemiology of malaria, where I develop mathematical and likelihood-based models of *Plasmodium falciparum* epidemiology and drug-resistance evolution to address antimalarial drug resistance in malaria parasites in African countries. In my free time, I enjoy attending classical concerts🎶, exercising🏊🏿‍♂️, and deciding which movie to watch next🎬.
