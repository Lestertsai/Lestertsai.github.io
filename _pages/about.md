I’m a first-year PhD student in the [Boni Lab](https://mol.ax) at [Temple Unviersity](https://www.temple.edu). My research focuses on the epidemiology of malaria, where I build mathematical models to address the problem of drug resistance in malaria treatment. As this issue is rapidly emerging in Africa, it is important to develop novel methods tailored to each country’s situation. In my free time, I enjoy attending classical concerts🎶, exercising🏊🏿‍♂️, and deciding which movie to watch next🎬.
