I’m interested in using mathematical models to address challenges in infectious diseases. Specifically, my research focuses on developing models of malaria epidemiology and the evolution of drug resistance in African countries. As drug resistance to malaria emerges in different regions, it is important to develop long-term strategies that can slow this trend while maintaining the efficacy of treatments. Currently, I am studying how people use antimalarial drugs and how these usage patterns drive the development of drug resistance.
